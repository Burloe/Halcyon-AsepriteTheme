## Halcyon theme for Aseprite
This theme gives Aseprite a subtle facelift along with custom icons to spruce up your pixel art drawing experience! Certain elements have been resized to provide a better user experience on larger monitors. The theme comes in two versions, one without white outlines and one with for all the tool icons(and some other editor icons).
